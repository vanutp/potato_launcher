# Instance Builder Specification File Format

The `spec.json` file is used to define the specifications for generating instances. Below is the format of the `spec.json` file and an explanation of each field.

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "download_server_base": "string",
  "resources_url_base": "string",
  "versions": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "minecraft_version": "string",
      "loader_name": "string",
      "loader_version": "string",
      "include": ["string"],
      "include_no_overwrite": ["string"],
      "include_from": "string",
      "replace_download_urls": "boolean",
      "auth_backend": {
        "type": "string",
        "data_field1": "data_value1",
        "other_data_fields": "other_data_values"
      },
      "exec_before": "string",
      "exec_after": "string"
    }
  ],
  "exec_before_all": "string",
  "exec_after_all": "string"
}
```

## Fields

### Root Fields

- **download_server_base**: The base URL where the instance will be deployed. All files in the generated folder (`generated` by default) must be accessible by `<download_server_base>/<file_relative_path>` after deployment. For example, the version manifest has to be at `<download_server_base>/version_manifest.json`.
- **resources_url_base**: The base URL for assets (optional). Should be equal to `<download_server_base>/assets/objects` if the generated folder structure is not changed after upload.
- **replace_download_urls**: A boolean indicating whether to replace download URLs (e.g., of vanilla libraries or assets).
- **versions**: An array of version specifications (see below for details).
- **exec_before_all**: A bash command to execute before processing all versions (optional).
- **exec_after_all**: A bash command to execute after processing all versions (optional). Can be used to automatically deploy the generated files in any possible way (e.g., by `rsync`'ing them to the server with `nginx`).

### Version Fields

- **name**: The name of the version.
- **minecraft_version**: The Minecraft version for this instance.
- **loader_name**: The name of the mod loader ("vanilla", "fabric", "forge" or "neoforge"; "vanilla" by default).
- **loader_version**: The version of the mod loader (optional; latest for fabric and `recommended` for forge if not set).
- **include**: A list of additional files or directories to include in the instance (optional; e.g., mods).
- **include_no_overwrite**: A list of files or directories to include without overwriting existing files (optional; e.g., configs).
- **include_from**: A directory from which to include files (optional).
- **auth_backend**: Authentication data for accessing protected resources (optional).
  - **type**: The authentication provider name (e.g., "telegram" for [this telegram format](https://foxlab.dev/minecraft/tgauth-backend)).
  - Any additional fields for the selected authentication provider.
- **exec_before**: A command to execute before processing this version (optional).
- **exec_after**: A command to execute after processing this version (optional).

# Running Instance Builder

To build instances for the launcher, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Configuration**: Ensure that your `spec.json` file is properly configured. You can use the provided [spec.json.example](spec.json.example) as a reference.

2. **Run the Builder**: Execute the Instance Builder with the following command:

    ```sh
    cargo run --release -p instance_builder -- -s <path to spec.json>
    ```

This will process the versions specified in your `spec.json` file and generate the instance files accordingly.

3. **Deploy the Generated Files**: If you have specified any `exec_after_all` commands in your `spec.json`, they will be executed after all versions are processed. You can use this to deploy the generated files, for example, by using `rsync` to upload them to a server.
